# 🚀 Counter Flutter App – My First Flutter Project

This project is a customized **Counter App** built using Flutter as part of my learning journey. Instead of sticking to the default template, I explored and implemented features that helped me understand the core Flutter concepts in a more practical way.

---

## ✅ What I Implemented

- ➕ Increment, ➖ Decrement, and 🔁 Reset functionality
- 🚫 Logic to prevent negative counts
- 🎨 Custom UI with padding, rounded corners, and color theming
- 📝 Used `TextTheme.displayMedium` for scalable, clean text
- 🧠 Learned basics of Flutter layout, widgets, and state management

---

## 💡 Why This Project?

This was my **first ever Flutter project**, and it gave me hands-on experience with:
- Widget structuring
- Stateful and Stateless widgets
- UI customization
- Dart fundamentals
